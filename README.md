# HalmaAI
A 2D game playing Agent
In this project, we will play the game of Halma, an adversarial game with some similarities to
checkers. The game uses a 16x16 checkered gameboard. Each player starts with 19 game pieces
clustered in diagonally opposite corners of the board. To win the game, a player needs to
transfer all of their pieces from their starting corner to the opposite corner, into the positions
that were initially occupied by the opponent.
Extensive use of various data-structures and algorithms with the spotlight on Minimax Algorithm; used Priority Queues and Alpha-Beta pruning for 
optimization purposes.
